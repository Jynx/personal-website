                When I was 6, I designed my first game called &quot;Space Dork
                2000&quot;, and boy was it <i>Impressive</i>. Heavily influenced
                by Space Quest and Hero Quest, staple adventure games of that
                time period, you played as a main character trapped in a world
                of aliens, monsters, ...and apparently a ridiculous amount of
                fart jokes? At least that&apos;s what the 2 page word document
                (now framed on my wall) describes. It seems crazy looking back
                on it now, but I was 6, I was proud of it, and it would have a
                profound impact on my life.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I wasn&apos;t preoccupied with designing crazy games, you
                would find me tinkering with computers (as it was the thing that
                allowed me to play games). I still vividly remember installing a
                &quot;scuzzy&quot; drive with my father on our family computer.
                He claimed it would rocket us into the peripherals stratosphere,
                and he was right. I had never seen loading screens that short.
              </p>
              <p>
                I soon realized that most of my interests were centered around
                games, computers, and building things in general. Those
                interests lead to my pursuit of a degree in Computer Science,
                which allowed me to complete the ultimate gamer trifecta of
                playing, assembling, and programming.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, I&apos;m still a gamer, tinkerer, and builder. I have
                developed software for a wide array of industries and
                communities, including games, player support, accounts, banking,
                ecommerce, social networking, and more. While I have developed
                many different types of software, my most memorable and
                impactful work has been developing software and tools that
                helped foster and support gaming communities.
